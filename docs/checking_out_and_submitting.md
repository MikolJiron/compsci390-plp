# Checking Out Assignments

All assignments are stored in this repo.

You can checkout using any git tool you are familiar with, but if you
like the command line version it looks like this:

    git clone https://github.com/hewner/compsci390-plp.git

If you've already checked out the repo and want to make sure you're
getting the latest version of the class notes and assignments, be sure
to pull.

    git pull

# Submitting Assignments

Simply submit all source code files to the corresponding Sakai assignment.

## What files should I upload?

* Don't upload files we provide but that you haven't edited
  (e.g. tests)
* Don't zip all your files together - that makes things annoying
* Don't include compiled files
