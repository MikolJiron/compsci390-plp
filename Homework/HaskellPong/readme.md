# Haskell Pong

So I'd like you to go through the very nice tutorial here:

http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/haskell-gloss/

(I've also put [a pdf](tutorial.pdf) in the repo, but I think you'll
find the HTML version nicer)

The [given code](Main.hs) is the first stage of the graphics part of
the tutorial, although you are welcome to start from scratch.

It is a good introduction both to Haskell's package system Cabal and
gloss, the graphics library we'll be using in Haskell.

For the homework, complete the tutorial itself and Exercises 1-3.
