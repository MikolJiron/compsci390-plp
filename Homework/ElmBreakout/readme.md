# What to do

Implement a pong-like game with only one paddle.  The ball should
bounce off the edges of the board, the paddle, and the board should
also include rectangle obstructions the ball should bounce off of.

Here's an example board with 3 obstructions.

It should be easy in your solution to add new obstructions or
reconfigure the obstructions by editing the initial model.

Here's some code to start with:
[breakout.elm](breakout.elm)

# Some minor details

1.  You are not required to implement any win condition detection
2.  Note that to use my code you'll have to install elm - you can't
use the web interface.  The reason is that the Keyboard package isn't
setup on the web interface.  If you want to switch it to somehow use
the mouse that's fine too.
